=== TO INSTALL ===

Requires: java 1.4 or higher

simply unpack the tar file, which you've likely done if you are reading this.
Optionally, customize the GUI (see below).  You probably want to set 
the location of the ddf directories.


=== TO RUN === 

UNIX/LINUX/MAC: 
cd to the directory in which the jar file and configs file are unpacked.
type oopgui at prompt.

note: to run the oopgui outside of the installation directory, set the 
OOPGUI_DIR variable to the installation directory in the oopgui script.

WINDOWS:
browse to the directory where the files were unpacked.
double-click on oopgui.bat


=== Customizing the GUI ===

A few constants in the GUI can be specified in the oopgui_cfg.xml.  
Of particular use are the default directories for reading and writing ddfs.

  <File paramName="DDF_READ_PATH" value="~/ddfs"
    desc="Name of the directory to read DDFs" />
  <File paramName="DDF_WRITE_PATH" value="~/ddfs/"
    desc="Name of the directory to write DDFs" />

To override, simply specify the correct path in the value attribute.  
~ can be used for File tags to represent the your home directory.

Other settings available can be found in OOPGUIParameters.java.  
This file is provided for reference only.  The GUI does not use the 
code included in this particular copy of the file, since it relies
on a previously compiled version.  Therefore, setting values in this
file will not have any effect.  To override the values of the constants in
this file, set them in the XML config file oopgui_cfg.xml.

See the attached ucla_gui_configuration.pdf for more information
